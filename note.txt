    Defining the function generate_summary:
        The function takes a job description and an optional parameter num_sentences (default value is 3) which specifies the number of sentences in the summary.
        It starts by tokenizing the job description into sentences and words, and removes stopwords.

    Calculating Word Frequencies:
        It calculates word frequencies in the job description, normalizing them by the maximum frequency.

    Scoring Sentences:
        For each sentence in the job description, it computes a score based on the word frequencies of the words in that sentence. It penalizes longer sentences.
        The score for each sentence is the sum of normalized frequencies of its constituent words.

    Selecting Top Sentences:
        It selects the top num_sentences sentences with the highest scores to form the summary.

    Returning the Summary:
        The function returns the generated summary as a string.

    Example Job Description:
        An example job description string is provided for demonstration purposes.

    Generating and Printing the Summary:
        The script generates the summary using the generate_summary function and prints it to the console.
